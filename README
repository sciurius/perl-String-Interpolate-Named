String-Interpolate-Named - Interpolated named arguments in string

String::Interpolate::Named provides a single function, interpolate,
that takes a string and substitutes named variables by target texts.

Example:

    use String::Interpolate::Named;

    my $ctl = { args => { fn => "Johann", ln => "Bach" } };
    say interpolate( $ctl, "The famous %{fn} %{ln}." );
    # Result = "The famous Johann Bach"

Other features are selecting true/false texts:

    "The task is %{done|ready|unfinished}."

Testing specific values:

    "%{instrument=piano|Play this with elbows}"

Selecting one out of a list of values:

    "First customer is %{customer.1}"
